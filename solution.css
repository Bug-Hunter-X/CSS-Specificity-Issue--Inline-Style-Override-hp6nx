To solve this, we can increase the specificity of the `.important-text` selector.  This can be done by adding another selector (e.g., an ID or more classes) to make it more specific than the inline style.

Here's an updated CSS solution:

```css
/* solution.css */
#myHeading {
  color: red; /* More specific selector */
}
```
Now the `#myHeading` selector is more specific than the inline style and will correctly apply the red color.

The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where a specificity conflict arises between an inline style and a selector with higher specificity.  The `h1` element will unexpectedly render with the color blue instead of red because of the inline style overriding the higher-priority selector. This can be difficult to track because it's a matter of CSS specificity rules rather than a simple syntax error.
